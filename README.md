## Summary

You can click on the zombies to kill them, if the kitty's healthbar reaches 0, you lose!

This is a game made in **Lua** with the **LOVE2D** framework. I am planning on developing it further in the future

## About me

I am a college student who's actively learning how to develop videogames! This is my first Lua game and I had the task to learn it in less than a week. You can find me on [Itch.io](https://gensofi24.itch.io/) or contact me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/s.alvarezz_/)

## Download Instructions
Download [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) and follow the [instructions that it gives you](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page), open the folder with main.lua in it and put it in your chosen IDE. I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
